<p>There are two approaches available to users for interacting with the HWP model. The first way is to use the web application. Users can view a variety of graphical outputs from the California and Oregon data sets and manipulate the figures to a degree. Users can also upload their own data (see the next section, Providing your own data) and view the same sorts of figures, reflecting their own data. Users can also download the model to their computer. This option allows them to run the web app locally on their own machine. It also lets them operate the stand-alone version of the model, which is a code-based environment that does not produce the web app.</p>
</div>
<div id="basic-web-interactivity-shiny-app" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Basic web interactivity – Shiny app<a href="operating-and-changing-the-model.html#basic-web-interactivity-shiny-app" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://groomanalyticsllc.shinyapps.io/HWP_Shared_Test/">web site</a> allows users to switch between two default data sets, California and Oregon state-wide timber harvest. The menu bar on the left has some drop-down plotting and data upload options.</p>
<p>The app was designed to aid users by providing figures that could usefully be incorporated into reports. To that end, all figures can be saved (with one exception) and the title for each figure can be customized.</p>
<div id="timber-harvest-summaries" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Timber Harvest Summaries<a href="operating-and-changing-the-model.html#timber-harvest-summaries" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The three figure options are Annual Timber Harvest (the starting default), Fate of Harvest Carbon, and Utilized Timber Harvest.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first option, Annual Timber Harvest, shows the volume of harvest by year and ownership. Users can toggle between seeing just total harvest volumes, ownership volumes, or both simultaneously. As in all figures, users can select seeing results by Tg C or Tg CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>e. This figure additional allows users to see results by BBF. Results can be displayed by the year or cumulatively over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Fate of Harvest Carbon. This tab has two figures, a Sankey diagram and a more static figure to the lower right. Users can, by mouse, manipulate the location of the vertical bars. Mouse-overs of the figure will also reveal the amount of carbon (Tg C / Tg C02e) in pools or transitioning to pools. The figure depicts the fate, over time, of harvested carbon from a single year. The user selects the harvest date of interest and the years post-harvest to track the fate of carbon in the system. The same data are displayed in the lower-right figure, with the figure displaying over time the residence of carbon in different pools and emissions categories. The vertical line depicts the data slice displayed in the Sankey diagram. The Sankey diagram’s html code can be downloaded but cannot be saved as a pdf (the stand-alone version of the model can provide a PNG-savable version). The lower-right figure may be saved as a PNG file.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilized Timber Halflives. The HWP model has different half-lives for products in use. This figure bins the annual volume of harvest sent to different end use products by their associated half-lives. The figure displays values by either the harvest volume or proportion of total harvest.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="carbon-storage-and-emissions" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Carbon Storage and Emissions<a href="operating-and-changing-the-model.html#carbon-storage-and-emissions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>These four figures track the size of pools and emissions categories over time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Carbon Storage by Ownership. If harvest data by ownership are available, the figure plots the amount of carbon stored in products in use and SWDS. Users can select which ownership values are displayed along with whether to display products in use data, SWDS data, or both.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Carbon Storage and Emissions. This selection allows viewers to access three similar figures of cumulative carbon states over time. All three allow users to view any combination of products in use, SWDS, and emissions categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary Pool and Emission Categories: This figure displays general storage (products in use, SWDS) and emissions (emissions with energy capture, emission without energy capture).</li>
<li>Pool and emission category components: This figure allows users to visualize emissions and storage pool components.</li>
<li>Pools and emissions by halflife category: Storage and emissions categories are displayed by halflife category.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Annual Net Change in Carbon Storage. These figures display annual change in stocks (products in use, SWDS; IPCC simple decay approach – stock change) or net balance (previous year’s harvest, emissions with and without energy capture; IPCC simple decay approach - net balance). The option to add a line with “net” displays the annual change in products in use plus SWDS. For the “IPCC simple decay approach - net balance” figure, the previous year’s harvest value minus the change in emissions values equal the change in products in use plus SWDS.</p></li>
<li><p>Monte Carlo Estimates. Two of these three figures display mean cumulative values from the Monte Carlo simulations with 90% confidence intervals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cumulative carbon in individual storage and emission pools: There are separate results for Emitted with Energy Capture, Emitted without Energy Capture, Products in Use, and Solid Waste Disposal Sites.<br />
</li>
<li>Cumulative carbon in storage pools combined (Products in use + SWDS): This figure summed the products in use + SWDS values within each iteration of the Monte Carlo and provides the mean plus 90% confidence interval.<br />
</li>
<li>Monte Carlo convergence evaluation: This figure displays sequential iteration results for the final year of the Monte Carlo simulation. It shows values for the 5th and 95th percentiles of values (i.e., the boundaries of the 90% confidence intervals), the value for the mean and standard error (se) over time. The Monte Carlo estimation process allows for a burn-in period, for which iteration values prior to that period are discarded from the estimation (pink vertical line). If values after the burn-in period appear unstable, more iterations may be needed to arrive at reasonable values. If they appeared to stabilize long before the burn-in period, then the Monte Carlo may provide reliable results with fewer iterations.</li>

<p>These items provide users with links to this documentation, which in turn describes aspects of the web application, the workings of the HWP model, and how users can upload their own data and download the source code.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Documentation: The link to this document.</p></li>
<li><p>Data templates: Regional templates that users can alter when preparing their own data for entry into the HWP model.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload Data: This selection allows users to load their own Excel file of data, verify that the file is formatted completely, and run the model. Once the model is run, the upper left “Select a data set” option will have a third option; namely, the new data set. All of the Shiny figures (except for the Monte Carlo Estimates selection) will plot the new data accordingly. The user must run the Monte Carlo separately from the page to populate the Monte Carlo figures with their data. The Monte Carlo simulation is run separately because it may take a few minutes to run. For details on preparing and uploading your own data, see the section Providing your own data.</p></li>

<p>The Shiny <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-shiny" role="doc-biblioref">Chang et al. 2021</a>)</span> application and stand-alone implementation of the HWP model are available on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. You will need to have Git installed on your computer, connect Git to RStudio, and finally tell RStudio where the GitHub files are to download (pull). Once you have these files you will have the most up-to-date version of the deployed code.</p>
<div id="r-rstudio-github-and-downloading-the-files" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> R, RStudio, GitHub, and downloading the files<a href="operating-and-changing-the-model.html#r-rstudio-github-and-downloading-the-files" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>You will need to have <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/">RStudio</a> installed on your computer. Both are free. R is the base program that executes the code; RStudio is an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, that brings ease and power to using R. You will operate R through RStudio.</p>
<p>You will need to have a program called Git installed on your computer. It may already be installed. There is a bit of a learning curve to getting Git up and going, as well as connecting to GitHub through RStudio. However, there is a great website that can smooth the way: <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/index.html">Happy Git and GitHub for the useR</a>. Another excellent website is <a href="https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/git-with-rstudio/">here</a>. If you are not already using GitHub or similar, getting Git/GitHub/RProject set up may take an hour or two. I recommend reading through the website carefully and following its instructions. Going slowly is going quickly.</p>
<p>Based on Chapter 16 in Happy Git and Github (specifically 16.2), and assuming your RStudio connects to GitHub, perform the following:<br />
1. Select a location on your computer where you would like a folder containing the code to be placed.<br />
2. Start R studio.<br />
3. Select the following menu options: File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git<br />
4. In the “repository URL” paste the URL of the HWP model’s GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/jeremygroom/HWP_Shared_Test.git" class="uri">https://github.com/jeremygroom/HWP_Shared_Test.git</a><br />
This will automatically populate the blank below the URL with the project name (HWP_Shared_Test).<br />
5. Click “Create Project”</p>
<p>RStudio will now open the HWP_Shared_Test.Rproj file for you. Within RStudio select from the menu File &gt; Open File… . Select the file app.r and click on the Open button. The next step is to run all of the code in the app.r file. There are several ways to do this. One way is to click on the code itself, select all of the code (ctrl+A on a PC, apple+A on a Mac), and then ctrl+Enter (or apple+Enter) will run everything. Or, go to the menu item and select Code &gt; Source. From within this project, open the R files “app.r” to access and run the Shiny app (Open the “HWP_Stand_Alone_Code.R” to run the model outside of the app.</p>
<p>Users can run one or more lines of code by highlighting them and pressing ctrl-Enter or apple-Enter, or from the RStudio menu selecting Code &gt; Run Selected Line(s).</p>
<p>The first line of the app.r or HWP_Stand_Alone_Code.R is: <code>renv::restore()</code>. The first time you run this line the project file will (with your permission) download all versions of all libraries and the R instance used to run the app <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-renv" role="doc-biblioref">Ushey 2022</a>)</span>. It takes a little while, but you’ll only need to do it once. This version control step hopefully helps prevent conflicts between your newer or older versions of previously-installed R libraries and the code.</p>
<p>The stand-alone relies heavily upon functions and code chunks in the Shiny app file (HWP_Shiny_app &gt; R_code_data). Updates to model code affect both the app and stand-alone code. The guts of the HWP model are in the file HWP_Model_Function.r . The file HWP_Model_Prep.R is used in several places for preparing data for entry into the model or versions of the model (HWP, Monte Carlo HWP, Sankey HWP).</p>

<p><em>HWP_Shiny_App/R_code_data/</em><br />
Most of the code that the Shiny application and stand-alone HWP model depend upon is in this folder:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>dl_module.R: Shiny module that allows figures to be downloaded.</p></li>
<li><p>global.r: Initial code for reading in data for the Shiny application.</p></li>
<li><p>HWP.CA.output.rds, HWP.OR.output.rds: prepared data files that the Shiny application automatically imports to populate its figures.</p></li>
<li><p>HWP_Model_Function.r: This is the raw code for the HWP model, as is run by the stand-alone and the Shiny application. Note that simplified versions of this code are used for the Sankey diagram (located in PlotFunctions1.r) and the Monte Carlo simulation (see MC_Code.R).</p></li>
<li><p>HWP_Model_Prep.R: Code that extracts values from imported data and prepares them for entry into the HWP model functions.</p></li>
<li><p>HWP_Output_Prep.R: Code that simplifies variable names from HWP model function output.</p></li>
<li><p>HWP_Tables_Code.R: Generates output tables (CSV files) that the user can use to recreate plots. The Shiny application has a button that will appear on the Upload Data selection that allows users to download the tables. The stand-alone code also uses this code to populate its own folder for tables (see below).</p></li>
<li><p>LakePic_MC2.png, ShrubPic3.png: Pretty pictures for populating figure space when user data are not available.</p></li>
<li><p>MC_Code.R: This code runs the Monte Carlo simulation using user data. It is used by the Shiny application and the stand-alone model.</p></li>
<li><p>ModelRunPage.R: This module produces the Upload Data page for the Shiny application.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot modules. Each of these provides the code to run individual Shiny figure tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plot_AnNetChCStor_Module.R: Produces the Annual Net Change in Carbon Storage tab underneath the header Carbon Storage and Emissions.<br />
</li>
<li>Plot_AnnTimHarvest_Module.R: Produces the Annual Timber Harvest tab underneath the header Timber Harvest Summaries.<br />

<li>Plot_CStorEm_Module.R: Produces the Carbon Storage and Emissions tab underneath the header Carbon Storage and Emissions.<br />
</li>
<li>Plot_CStorOwn_Module.R: Produces the Carbon Storage by Ownership tab underneath the header Carbon Storage and Emissions.<br />
</li>
<li>Plot_FateHarvC_Module.R: Produces the Fate of Harvest Carbon tab underneath the header Timber Harvest Summaries.<br />
</li>
<li>Plot_MCest_Module.R: Produces the Monte Carlo Estimates tab underneath the header Carbon Storage and Emissions.<br />
</li>
<li>Plot_UtTimbHL_Module.R: Produces the Utilized Timber Halflives tab underneath the header Timber Harvest Summaries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>PlotFunctions1.r: This code contains many of the functions used repeatedly by figures and the HWP model variants (standard HWP, Monte Carlo, and Sankey). It also contains the Sankey HWP model function. This code is source by the Shiny application and the stand-alone model.</p></li>
<li><p>QA_Code_Shiny.r: This code runs a Quality Assurance procedure on imported data. It verifies that the data are formatted correctly for entry into the HWP and Monte Carlo models. See “The QA Step” under “Providing Your Own Data.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>/HWP_Stand_Alone_Files/Arrays/</em><br />
This folder serves as a destination for the arrays generated by the stand-alone code, given that the user’s data file indicates that arrays should be generated. The .gitignore file prevents the source code from uploading the arrays to GitHub.</p>
<p><em>/HWP_Stand_Alone_Files/QAQC_Reports/</em><br />
This folder contains the error report (Error_Report.csv) generated by the stand-alone code’s call to QA_Code_Shiny.r. The .gitignore file prevents the source code from uploading any error reports in this folder to GitHub.</p>
<p><em>/HWP_Stand_Alone_Files/Standalone_R_files/</em><br />
This folder contains two code files, MC_Tables.R and Sankey_Code.r. If the user indicates that the stand-alone code should generate tables of the Monte Carlo outcome, the MC_Tables.R file generates the tables. If the user indicates that the stand-alone code should generate a Sankey figure the Sankey_Code.r file will do so.</p>
<p><em>/HWP_Stand_Alone_Files/Tables/</em><br />
This folder serves as a destination for tables generated by the stand-alone code, given that the user’s data file indicates that arrays should be generated. The tables are the same as those generated by the Shiny application after the user has run the HWP model on their own data and then selected the button that generates the tables. The .gitignore file prevents the source code from uploading any tables in the folder to GitHub.</p>
<p><em>/renv/</em><br />
This folder contains R environment variables that the Shiny application (app.r) and stand-alone model (HWP_Stand_Alone_Code.R) rely upon. The environmental variables include version information for R and the libraries used. The user can ignore this folder.</p>
<p><em>/rsconnect/</em><br />
This folder contains shinyapps.io deployment information. The user can ignore this folder.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Running the Shiny app from your computer<a href="operating-and-changing-the-model.html#running-the-shiny-app-from-your-computer" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As stated above, if this is the first time you are running this code, it may take a little while as renv will need to load appropriate program and package versions. Once you have run the Shiny application code, RStudio will display the application in its own window. A button at the top of the window will allow you to open the application in your own browser, but this isn’t necessary. The application should function as it does online when run from the Shinyapps.io server.</p>
<p>The user can alter the Shiny code to produce different figures or to extract intermediary or final data frames used for figure generation. As a warning, if the user alterations cause an error, the Shiny application can break. Troubleshooting in a Shiny application is not as straightforward as it is in standard R code (In the online book <a href="https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html">Mastering Shiny</a> by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wickham2021" role="doc-biblioref">Wickham</a> (<a href="#ref-wickham2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, see <a href="https://mastering-shiny.org/action-workflow.html">Chapter 5 Section 2, Debugging</a>). I will not discuss the workings of Shiny to any extent here (if interested, see the previous link for more information), but if the user inserts the code <code>browser()</code> immediately after an item of interest, saves the change to the code, re-runs the Shiny app from their computer, and selects the figure or item of interest from the application, the code will halt at the <code>browser()</code> call and the user can inspect all elements created to that point.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-stand-alone-model-benefits-utility-and-how-to-operate" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> The Stand-alone model: benefits, utility, and how to operate<a href="operating-and-changing-the-model.html#the-stand-alone-model-benefits-utility-and-how-to-operate" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The stand-alone model provides the user with little additional utility over the web-based Shiny application. It will produce arrays used by the model, and these can be useful for reconstructing analysis results and understanding how the model operates. It can also produce the Sankey diagram, but within RStudio. The RStudio Plots window has an Export option that will save the HTML code as a PNG file, an option that the Shiny application cannot provide. However, the PNG resolution is not much greater than a screen shot of the Sankey from the web application. The PNG version also does not reflect any manipulation of the figure by the user after the figure was produced (e.g., if the user slides the categories around to better separate them, the PNG will show the figure as initially produced).</p>
<p>The main advantage of the stand-alone model is that the user can step through it line by line to better understand what the code is doing. The code is arranged in a much more readable way than it is for the Shiny application. If the user wishes to alter the model code, be aware that changes to the HWP function or MC function may “break” the downloaded Shiny app was well (this is easily remedied via a quick pull request from the GitHub repository – select the “Git” tab in one of the RStudio windows and click the “Pull” button).</p>
<p>The user can step through the code piecewise or run all of the code at once after placing their data file in the HWP Data folder and entering their file name into the code as described below.</p>
<p>To run the stand-alone code, open the file “HWP_Shared_Test.Rproj.” This will open the R Project using the program R Studio. Open the file “HWP_Stand_Alone_Code.R.” Then, run the <code>renv::restore()</code> line plus the library load code. If this is the first time you are running the <code>renv::restore()</code> call, the process may take a few minutes to complete.</p>
<p>The next few lines select whether you wish to generate the Sankey diagram, which year you would like to generate it for, and for how many years the decay process should be run. Change <code>GENERATE.SANKEY = TRUE</code> to <code>GENERATE.SANKEY = FALSE</code> if you do not wish to generate the Sankey diagram. Change the year in <code>SANKEY.HARVEST.YEAR</code> and <code>SANKEY.YEARS.OF.HARVEST</code> to your year of interest and the number of years of decay, respectively. It would probably be most efficient to figure out these years/decay times beforehand using the Shiny application.</p>
<p>The <code>### Folder locations</code> lines should mostly remain unchanged unless you would like to move files about for some reason. The <code>IMPORT.DATA.FILE</code> value should be changed to the file name that you would like to import. Be sure your file is in the HWP Data folder (unless you’ve redefined the <code>IMPORT.DATA.FOLDER</code> location accordingly). Run these lines.</p>
<p>Run the lines for loading the data, including those for the QA test (approximately lines 50 through 85). The code, given your file name, will open your file and extract worksheets. If the user data prescribes the QA test to be run, this code will source the QA_Code_Shiny.r file. Otherwise, it will skip the QA test and load the files automatically. The QA test takes little computation time, so omitting this step does not speed up the code greatly.</p>
<p>Run lines 90 – 111. These lines source code that prepares the data for entry into the model and extracts certain options from the user data, like whether to save tables and arrays, and the locations where they should be saved. The code also sources the PlotFunctions1.r code to obtain some functions used by the HWP model, and the HWP model function itself.</p>
<p>Running lines 112 – 128 causes the code to run the HWP model and extract the model function’s outputs.</p>
<p>Running lines 130 – 148 enact a year-shift in the data if the user wishes. The year-shift causes all fates from harvest (waste from processing, placement of carbon in products in use, etc.) to occur the year after harvest.</p>
<p>Running lines 150 – 164 will generate table CSV files in the Tables folder if the user’s data defines <code>OUTPUT_TABLES</code> to be <code>TRUE</code>. Otherwise the code is skipped.</p>
<p>Lines 165 – 200 will generate array Excel files in the Arrays folder if the user’s data defines <code>OUTPUT_ARRAYS</code> to be <code>TRUE</code>. Otherwise the code is skipped. Note that array generation does take some noticeable time; it may be useful to set this option in the data to FALSE when running the overall code set frequently.</p>
<p>Lines 200 – 210 cause the Monte Carlo to run. The Monte Carlo can be very time-consuming to run. Consider setting the data option to <code>FALSE</code> if only outputs from the regular HWP model are needed.</p>
<p>Lines 211 – 220 run the Sankey code if the user selected for the generation of the Sankey diagram to take place (<code>TRUE</code>).</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-add-new-data-years-to-your-data-set" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.3.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.5</span> How to add new data years to your data set<a href="operating-and-changing-the-model.html#how-to-add-new-data-years-to-your-data-set" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Users may wish to generate model outputs annually or every few years with new harvest values. However, they may not want to alter all of the worksheets in their data file by hand to account for the newly added harvest years. The file Append_Harvest_Data.R takes, as input, an Excel file with a single worksheet of harvest by board feet, formatted in the same way as their earlier Harvest_BF worksheet. The user points the code toward their original data file, the new Harvest_BF Excel file, and provides a name for the output Excel file. The code will make all necessary changes to the original file and append the new years. Importantly, where needed, the code will read values used for the year prior and duplicate them for the new data. Therefore, if the user wishes to update Timber Product Ratios or End Use Ratios, they will need to do so by hand, possibly after this procedure is run.</p>
<p>As an example, say we wish to add 2018 and 2019 harvest levels to Oregon’s data. We open the Append_Harvest_Data.R file in the <code>HWP_SHARED_TEST</code> RStudio project, run the first few lines that load the needed libraries, and then alter the following lines to read:<br />
<code>ORIG.DATA.FILE &lt;- "Oregon_Inputs_HWP_Model.xlsx"</code><br />
<code>NEW.DATA &lt;- "Oregon_BF_2019.xlsx"</code><br />
<code>DATA.FOLDER &lt;- "HWP Data/"</code><br />
<code>OUT.DATA &lt;- "Oregon_Inputs_HWP_Modelv2.xlsx"</code></p>
<p>The first of those lines refers to the original data, the second the name of the file with the Harvest_BF data for the new years, the third line identifies the location of the input data files, and the last line is the name the user wishes to use for the updated data set.</p>
<p>The new data can provide all of the original data for harvest board feet in addition to the more recent harvest data. Or, the user can provide just the new data. Once those four lines are correct the user can select and run all of the code from the file. The code will attempt to generate a new Excel file with the desired updates. The code also performs some QA checks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Verifies that data are numeric</p></li>
<li><p>Verifies that the original and new data do not duplicate or skip years</p></li>
<li><p>If ownership data are present in the original data, the code verifies that ownership data exist in the new data too, and that the Total column equals the sum of other ownership columns.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The code will print error messages if any of those tests are not passed.</p>
<p>If errors are encountered and the files are altered to correct those errors, be sure to close the newly generated file before running the code again. Otherwise, R will generate an error message.</p>

When uploading data, there can be an error message that appears in red right below the Browse button:   
`<!DOCTYPE HTML><html lang=”en”><head>`  

If this appears it is best to rebuild the excel file.  There does not appear to be a way to circumvent this issue aside from constructing a new file (the file name is probably irrelevant so long as it does not contain weird characters).  We recommend that users cut-copy-paste from the excel file into a blank file.

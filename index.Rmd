# Summary       {#sum}

The Harvested Wood Products (HWP) model is a deterministic model which relies on optional and required user-supplied information.  The model is described in @stockmann2012.  There have been several builds of the model, on platforms including Microsoft Excel, C++, and now R [@R-base].  Another effort is currently underway to construct an interactive version of the model in Python.  This article describes a build of the model based on data from the U.S. west coast states of California, Oregon, and Washington.  This R-based platform allows for user interaction with California and Oregon data via a [web application](https://groomanalyticsllc.shinyapps.io/HWP_Shared_Test/).   Users may also upload their own data onto the app, run their data through the HWP model and associated Monte Carlo simulation, interact with their data, and construct and save figures.  Alternatively, users may access the full Shiny app code as well as a stand-alone version of the HWP model implementation. The stand-alone version allows users the opportunity to step through the code more easily, save model arrays for hand-calculation of outcomes, and alter the code to meet their own data needs.  Both versions allow users to download or generate the tables necessary to recreate figures to their own specifications. 
This document describes the model and structure of the code, explains how to generate input files, and provides instruction on accessing model code. 



## Acknowledgements    {#sum-ack}
Many thanks to Nadia Tase and Andrew Yost for supporting the development of this work through feedback, discussion, and their own efforts to dive into the code and understand the model at its core.  Jimmy Kagan and Amanda Reynolds provided administrative support.  We received feedback and support for the earlier iteration of the R-version of the model from Todd Morgan, Dan Loffler, Keith Stockmann, [OTHERS].  
This project was funded by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Purchase Order 3540-0000277546.  Earlier work on the project was funded by the Oregon Department of Forestry and supported by the Institute for Natural Resources, Oregon State University.  

## Abbreviations      {#sum-abb}

The following description uses many acronyms for brevity.  Here is a list of the most common:

BF: Board Feet   
BBF: Billion Board Feet   
BLM: Bureau of Land Management   
BWEC: Burned with Energy Capture   
EWEC: Emitted with Energy Capture   
EWOEC: Emitted without Energy Capture   
EUR: End-use Product Ratios   
HWP: Harvested Wood Products   
CCF: Hundred Cubic Feet   
IPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  
MBF: Thousand Board Feet), 
MT: Metric Tons   
MMT C: Million Metric Tons of Carbon   
PPR: Primary Product Ratios   
PIU; Products in Use   
SWDS: Solid Waste Disposal Sites   
Tg C: Teragrams of Carbon: Tg C   
Tg CO2e: Teragrams of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent   
TPO: Timber Product Output   
TPR: Timber Product Ratios   
USFS: United States Forest Service   


A note about units for carbon:  
Publications from the United States have frequently described carbon storage and emissions using the metric million metric tons carbon, or MMT C.  We are using the equivalent metric, teragrams of carbon (Tg C) in the HWP model and this manual to align with IPCC reporting requirements.

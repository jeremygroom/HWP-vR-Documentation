## General description of the HWP model    {#int-gen}

An overview schematic of the HWP model is provided in Figure \@ref(fig:overview-fig). For every year of consideration, timber harvest results in board-feet of timber arriving at mills.  These harvest values may be subdivided by the land ownership that produced the timber.  Timber values are multiplied by the timber product classes, then the primary product ratios for each timber products class, and finally the end-use ratios for each primary products class.  These resulting values are transformed to Tg C.  Some end-use ratios involve material that is burned for energy capture.  Other end-use products become products in use, although the process of creating those results in a percentage of the material ending up as discarded products.  Material entering discarded products is proportionally allocated to dumps, landfill, compost, or are recovered (recycled) or burned without energy capture.  

In the subsequent year more timber enters the cycle. However, the previous year’s carbon in products in use, dumps, recovered products, and the decaying portion of landfills are subjected to a half-life decay.  The outputs either end up in the discard category or are emitted to the atmosphere as CO$_2$.

## Model history   {#int-hist}

The HWP model began as an Excel macro originally created by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) for National Forest System regional HWP carbon inventories [@stockmann2012].  The Excel tool was updated to one programmed in C++ (v1; @stockmann2014).  The tool was then and modified in 2012 by the USFS for use in the California Forest Ecosystem and Harvested Wood Product Carbon Inventory [@christensen2019], and is given the label here as the CA USFS HWPC-C variant.  This history is described in Figure \@ref(fig:hist-fig).   

Groom Analytics LLC undertook programming the @stockmann2012 model in R for Oregon, and subsequently deployed the R version to a [web application](https://groomanalyticsllc.shinyapps.io/HWP_Shared_Test/).  This version of the model (HWP-C vR) described in this document largely functions the same as the original USFS Excel-based tool and the v1 tool.   A few changes exist and are described more fully in Christiansen et al. [-@christensen2020; -@christensen2021]. These  changes include:  

* Modification of lag times built in the original tool, in order to allow for better quality assurance of calculations.  
*	The original tool resulted in narrower confidences intervals than expected based on the parameters set for the Monte Carlo Uncertainty Analysis. This tool has established a new Monte Carlo simulation that has succeeded in introducing variability into the HWP C estimates.  

The USFS is currently updating their original tool, with public availability expected in 2022/2023. This version (HWP-C vR) is not intended to compete with or contradict the original USFS work, but rather complement the original work by being available in a different platform and coding language. This version includes new data visualizations.

## Model utility    {#int-util}

The HWP model (and associated visualizations) is a long-term accounting tool for carbon emissions and storage from harvested wood products.  Users can easily understand how harvest levels have changed over time, by ownership and in total.  Given changes in disposal methods and the assumed lifetime use of wood products, users can examine what proportion of harvested wood products remain in use, in disposal sites, or as CO$_2$ emitted to the atmosphere.  The model may be useful for planners and decision-makers to understand the emissions consequences of promoting wood products with different use lifespans.    

## HWP model assumptions and shortcomings    {#int-assump}

The HWP model is a closed model, and tracks only carbon harvested within a specified area.  Therefore, at a state level, emissions from HWP may be greater than expected from timber harvested within the state if the state imports timber or timber products.  Similarly, exported timber or timber products may experience different utilization or decay processes.    

The model assumes that harvested timber volume and ratios such as TPR, PPR, and EUR are valid.  The model can be expected to perform poorly if the ratios or other values are not based on solid evidence. The Monte Carlo attempts to explore the range of possible outcomes given different levels of certainty in the data.  The model does, ultimately, rely on many different data types.  Some of these, such as landfill decay rates, may be difficult to enumerate and thus we are unsure of their true values.    

The model does not (currently) differentiate between carbon in landfills that is emitted as methane vs. CO$_2$.  Methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO$_2$, albeit with a shorter residence time.   

The Monte Carlo takes a specific approach towards varying the ratios, constraining all ratios to sum to one.  Given the selected range of possible values for each variable, the resulting randomly selected values may not be independent from one another and may be unintentionally biased.  That is, within a ratio type that must sum to one and for a particular model iteration, if one value is randomly selected to equal 1.0, the remaining values for that ratio set must equal 0.    

Finally, we are not aware of any method for overall model validation.  Estimates for individual pieces of the model, such as product or decay half-lives, can be improved.  But, like all models, the HWP model simplifies reality greatly and hopefully provides users with useful insight by tracking and summarizing complicated calculation outputs in a reasonable way.    

## Future work    {#int-future}

Users can improve the model’s utility by researching and altering model input tables with their own regional information.  There is interest in incorporating a means for tracking the production of CO$_2$ separately from methane as methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas that results from anoxic decomposition such as occurs in landfills.  In the short term we plan to update the model so that users can control the discard ratios for paper and wood products.  Finally, work is currently being done at the University of Massachusetts  to explore the consequences of errors in estimating the capability of landfills to retain carbon without decay.
